    description: "As superfluous as something like animation may initially seem, you can tell a lot about framework by the way that it handles the concept of time. Idiosyncrasies and race conditions in rendering reveal themselves, pauses in DOM and virtual DOM diffing can be exposed. \n\n This is one of the ways Vue shows itself to be uniquely capable and elegant as a framework. In this session, we'll cover how to use the <transition> component and some of its offerings to create fluid effects in the browser. We'll move on to watchers and transitioning state. Finally, we'll talk about lifecycle methods, asynchronous updates, and pushing our animations to the next level."

Well let's do something crazy and different! Lets make it realtime. \n\n We will take a look at the best patterns when creating an application, and how the Vue.js ecosystem can power a PWA. Extending the PWA platform we will look how Sockets and Service Workers can coexist together. Creating a PRA (Progressive Realtime Application), allowing platforms to improve the user experience without affecting the critical download chain."
